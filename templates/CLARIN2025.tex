The following instructions are directed to all authors preparing a paper for CLARIN2025.
Some of these instructions differ slightly depending on whether one is submitting a version for initial reviewing, one is uploading an updated paper ahead of the conference, or one is uploading a final full paper for inclusion in the Proceedings after the conference.
Such differences will be clearly indicated in the remainder of this document.
All authors are required to adhere to these specifications,
as well as to the instructions in the \emph{Call for Abstracts}.

%Authors from countries in which access to word-processing systems is limited should contact clarin@clarin.eu as soon as possible.

\section{General Instructions}

All papers should be written in English, using either American or British spelling, and should be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF).\\

\textbf{\emph{NOTE: Since reviewing will be double-blind, author names should not appear in any submission to be reviewed (but should be given in the final accepted paper)}}.
Likewise, submissions to be reviewed must not mention contributors, project names, grant numbers, and names or URLs of resources or tools that have only been made publicly available in
the last three weeks or are about to be made public.
More detailed instructions on anonymisation will be given below.\\

The length of the manuscript, when written in the specified layout,
should conform to the minimum and maximum page limits described in the \emph{Call for Papers}.
There may be different page limits for extended abstracts before the conference and for full papers to be published in the Proceedings after the conference.
Papers that do not conform to the specified length and formatting requirements may be rejected without review.
Do not number the pages.


\subsection{Electronically Available Resources}

We prefer you to prepare your PDF files using LaTeX with the official CLARIN2025 style file (CLARIN2025.sty). These files are available via the CLARIN website, where you will also find the document you are currently reading (Template\_CLARIN2025.pdf). The LaTeX source code (CLARIN2025.tex) is available in Overleaf: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/read/qtvdcbqrmpfs}.\footnote{{https://www.clarin.eu/news/call-abstracts-clarin2025}}  

In practice, you can make a copy of this source code file (CLARIN2025.tex) and keep the preamble and basic structure but replace all content.\\

You can alternatively use Open Office or Microsoft Word to produce your PDF file. 
In this case, we strongly recommend the use of the Open Office template file
(CLARIN2025.odt) or the Microsoft Word template
(CLARIN2025.dotx) respectively, which are also available on the website.
%\textbf{Authors can freely choose between anonymous and non-anonymous submission.  }
%Should you chose the anonymous submission approach, we suggest that you anonymise  your source file so that the pdf produced does not retain your identity.  This can be done by removing any personal information from your source document properties.


\subsection{Providing Electronic Manuscripts in PDF} \label{sect:pdf}

All versions of the paper must be uploaded in Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF files are usually produced from
LaTeX using the \textit{pdflatex} command. If your version of
LaTeX produces Postscript files, you can convert these into PDF
using \textit{ps2pdf} or \textit{dvipdf}. On Windows, you can also use
Adobe Distiller to generate a PDF.\\

Please make sure that your PDF file includes all the fonts
with the necessary glyphs
(especially symbols and non-Latin
characters). When you print or create the PDF file, there is usually
an option in your printer setup to include none, all or just
non-standard fonts.  Please make sure that you select the option of
including ALL the fonts. Before sending it, test your PDF by
  printing it from a computer different from the one where it was
  created. Moreover, some word processors may generate very large PDF
files, where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may
reproduce poorly. In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the
PDF. One way on some systems is to install a driver for a postscript
printer, send your document to the printer specifying ``Output to a
file'', then convert the file to PDF.

\section{Layout} \label{ssec:layout}

It is of utmost importance to specify the A4 paper size (210~mm
x 297~mm). This is normally achieved by
specifying the \texttt{a4paper} option  in the document class.
When working with {\tt dvips}, one could also specify {\tt -t a4}.\\

Typeset manuscripts with a single column to a page.
The margins should be 25~mm on all sides, so that
the dimensions of the text area on an A4 page are 160~mm x 247~mm.
Manuscripts should be typed single-spaced.
Please make sure the text is hyphenated correctly.


\subsection{Fonts}

For reasons of uniformity, Times, Times Roman or Times New Roman fonts should be
used for normal text. This can be accomplished by putting the necessary commands
in the preamble of a LaTeX document. Two ways are possible, depending on whether you
use traditional LaTeX2e or the more modern XeLaTeX which supports
full Unicode directly in the source. In the latter case you make sure that your source is written
in UTF-8 and you specify at least the following in the preamble:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{xltxtra}
\setmainfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Times}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

In traditional LaTeX, you specify at least the following instead:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
 If Times Roman is unavailable, use Computer
 Modern Roman (LaTeX2e's default).  Note that the latter is about
 10\% less dense than Times.

Table \ref{font-table} specifies the sizes and styles to be used for 
different kinds of text elements.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|}
\hline \bf Type of Text & \bf Font Size & \bf Style \\ \hline
paper title & 15 pt & bold \\
author names & 12 pt & bold \\
author affiliation & 12 pt & \\
the word ``Abstract'' & 12 pt & bold \\
section titles & 12 pt & bold \\
subsection titles & 11 pt & bold\\
normal text & 11 pt  &\\
emphasis & & italic\\
captions & 11 pt & \\
sub-captions & 9 pt & \\
%abstract text & 10 pt & \\
bibliography & 10 pt & \\
footnotes & 9 pt & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{font-table} Font guide. }
\end{table}

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}

The title, author names and addresses should be \emph{identical}
to those entered to the electronical paper submission website in order
to maintain the consistency of author information among all
publications of the conference. If they are different, the publication
chairs may resolve the difference without consulting with you; so it
is in your own interest to double-check that the information is
consistent.
Centre the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across
the page. Do not use footnotes for affiliations. Do not include the
paper ID number which may be assigned during the submission process.\\

\textbf{\emph{NOTE: In the anonymous version submitted for initial review, your real names and addresses
should \emph{not} be filled out here (see also the General Instructions section above).}}\\

{\bf Title}: Place the title centred at the top of the first page, in
a 15 pt bold font. (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles,
see Table~\ref{font-table}) Long titles should be typed on two lines
without a blank line intervening.
Do not format title and other headings in all
capitals, except for proper names (such as ``BLEU'') that are
conventionally in all capitals.  \\

{\bf Authors and addresses}: Centred on the page,
below the title and a blank line, place the author's names(s), 
and the affiliation and addresses on subsequent lines.
Use full first (given) names (middle initials are allowed). Do
not format surnames in all capitals (e.g., use ``Schlangen'' not
``SCHLANGEN'').  

The affiliation should contain the
author's complete address, and an electronic mail
address. Start the body of the first page 75~mm from the top of the
page.
Again, in the anonymous version submitted for initial review, your real names and addresses
should \emph{not} be filled out here (see also the General Instructions section above).\\

{\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract between addresses and main body.
The width of the abstract text should be
smaller than main body by about 6~mm on each side.
Centre the word {\bf Abstract} in a 12 pt bold
font above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a concise
summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper. It should
be no longer than 200 words. The abstract text should be in normal font size (11pt).\\

{\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after
the abstract, observing the single-column format as shown in
the present document. Indent when starting a new paragraph. Use 11 pt for normal text.\\

{\bf Licence}: Include a licence statement as an unmarked (unnumbered)
footnote on the first page of the final, camera-ready paper.
See Section~\ref{licence} below for details and motivation.


\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Use numbered sections (with Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals. Avoid subsubsections.  Use 12 pt for section headings and 11 pt for subsection headings.\\

{\bf Acknowledgments}: Do not include an acknowledgments section
when submitting your paper for review, only in the final accepted version of the paper.
The acknowledgements section should go immediately before the references and its heading should not be numbered.\\

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}; place the section before any Appendices,
unless they contain references. Arrange the references alphabetically
by the last name of the first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format. Examples below use APA style.\\

{\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.

\section{Other Text Elements}

\subsection{Citations} \label{sec:citations}

Citations within the text appear in parentheses
as~\citep{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in the text
itself, as \citet{Gusfield:97}.  Append lowercase letters
to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat double authors as
in~\citep{Aho:72}, but when more than two
authors are involved, write as in~\citep{Chandra:81}. Collapse multiple citations as
in~\citep{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations in parentheses
as sentence constituents. For instance, instead of the following:
\begin{quote}
  ``\citeauthor{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
we suggest you use the following form:
\begin{quote}
``\citet{Gusfield:97}  showed that ...''
\end{quote}

Please consult Table \ref{apa-table} below for common citation options:

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \bf Command & \bf Citation\\ \hline
\verb|\citet{rasooli-tetrault-2015}|	& \citet{rasooli-tetrault-2015}  \\
\verb|\citep{Chandra:81}|	& \citep{Chandra:81} \\
\verb|\citep{Aho:72,Chandra:81}| & \citep{Aho:72,Chandra:81} \\
\verb|\citet*{Chandra:81}|	& \citet*{Chandra:81} \\
\verb|\citep*{Chandra:81}| &  \citep*{Chandra:81} \\
\verb|\citeauthor{andrew2007scalable}|	& \citeauthor{andrew2007scalable} \\
\verb|\citeauthor*{Chandra:81}| & \citeauthor*{Chandra:81} \\
\verb|\citeyear{Chandra:81}|	&  \citeyear{Chandra:81}\\

\verb|\citealp{Chandra:81}| 	& \citealp{Chandra:81}  \\
\verb|\citetext{priv.\ comm.}|	& \citetext{priv.\ comm.} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{apa-table} APA guide. }
\end{table}


\subsection{Footnotes}

Put footnotes at the bottom of the page in 9 pt
text. They are preferably numbered but can also be referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the line
separating the footnotes from the text.}

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Figures and tables}: Place figures (screenshots, photographs, diagrams etc.)
and tables in the paper near where they are first discussed,
rather than at the end, if possible.

If you use colour in illustrations, make sure that sufficient contrast is maintained
when printed in black ink. Try this by printing your document on a printer
with only black ink.

Narrow graphics in the single-column format may lead to
large empty spaces,
see for example the wide margins on both sides of Table~\ref{font-table}.
If you have multiple graphics with related content, it may be
preferable to combine them in one graphic.
You can identify the sub-graphics with sub-captions below the
sub-graphics numbered (a), (b), (c) etc.
The LaTeX packages wrapfig, subfig, subtable and/or subcaption
may be useful.\\


{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration and table; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' or ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.'' as illustrated in Table \ref{font-table}.
Type the captions of the figures and
tables below the body of those, using normal 11 pt text.


\subsection{Licence Statement}
\label{licence}

To avoid the need for sending signed copyright hand-over forms to the
organisers or publishers, we require that authors licence the final version
of accepted papers under a
Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence
(CC-BY).
This means that authors (or their employers) retain copyright but
grant everybody
the right to adapt and re-distribute their paper
as long as the authors are credited and modifications listed.\\ %\footnote{{http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/} for the licence terms.} 

Depending on whether you use American or British English in your
paper, please include one of the following as an unmarked
(unnumbered) footnote on page 1 of the \emph{final} version of your paper.
The LaTeX style file (CLARIN2022.sty) adds a command
\texttt{blfootnote} for this purpose, and usage of the command is
prepared in the LaTeX source code (CLARIN2022.tex) at the start
of Section~\ref{intro} ``Introduction''.

We cannot accept the restrictions ``NonCommercial'' (NC) and
``ShareAlike'' (SA) as they would
limit our options for publishing and printing,
nor the restriction ``NoDerivatives'' (ND) as it may impede our
ability to add page numbers and a footer, as well as our ability
to combine papers into volumes.
Page numbers and proceedings footer are added by the organizers.
%Mentioning in the footnote that we, the organisers, add page numbers and proceedings footer is a requirement stemming from the CC-BY licence terms.


\subsection{Translation of non-English Terms and Examples}

It is advised to supplement non-English characters and terms
with appropriate transliterations and/or translations.
Inline transliteration or translation can be represented in
the following order: original transliteration ``translation''.\\

Linguistic examples in languages other than English should normally be glossed
and provided with an translation in English on separate lines, as illustrated in (\ref{dutch}).
Several \LaTeX\ packages support glossed examples.

\begin{examples}
\item \label{dutch}
\gll Dit is een Nederlands voorbeeld-je.
This is a Dutch example-DIM.
\glt `This is a small example in Dutch.'
\glend
\end{examples}
